\title{Rollup phecode counts}
\usage{
rollup_phecode_counts(
  patient_code_counts,
  patient_col,
  phecode_col = phecode,
  count_col = count
)
}
\arguments{
\item{patient_code_counts}{Data containing patient ids, phecodes, and counts
of those phecodes.}

\item{patient_col}{Unquoted name of the column containing patient ids in
passed \code{patient_code_counts}'s dataframe.}

\item{phecode_col}{Unquoted name of the column containing phecodes in passed
dataframe.}

\item{count_col}{Unquoted name of the column containing counts of phecodes in
passed dataframe.}
}
\value{
Dataframe in same format as passed \code{patient_code_counts} with code
counts rolled up. This will most likely be longer than the original dataset
because of the addition of potentially previously ommitted codes.
}
\description{
Takes phecodes that have been coded without rollup - E.g. existance of code
008.10 does not imply the existance of 008.00 - and produces a rolledud
version of the dataset.
